// This file is kept for consistency with ShadCN structure but the actual hook (useCarousel)
// is now co-located within components/ui/carousel.tsx as per the latest ShadCN patterns
// for better modularity and easier understanding of the component's internals.
// No separate hook logic is needed here if useCarousel is defined in carousel.tsx.

// You can export the hook from carousel.tsx if needed elsewhere,
// or keep this file empty/remove it if you prefer all carousel logic in one place.
// For now, we'll leave it as a placeholder to show where it *would* go if separated.

// Example of re-exporting if you decide to keep useCarousel in carousel.tsx:
// export { useCarousel } from "@/components/ui/carousel"
export {}; // Placeholder to make it a valid module
